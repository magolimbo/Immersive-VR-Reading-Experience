# The Mata Hari Reading Experience

This project combines **Unity**, **Blender**, and the **Oculus Quest 2** to create an interactive VR reading environment. 
Unity was used for building the immersive experience, implementing physics-based interactions, object spawning, and page-flipping logic through the OpenXR library. 
Blender was employed to model and texture 3D assets such as the reading room and the Mata Hari crown, later optimized and integrated into Unity. 
The Oculus Quest 2 enabled both controller-based and **hand-tracking** input, allowing users to naturally interact with virtual objects.
